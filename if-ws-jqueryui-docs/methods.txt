# Methods

jQuery UI methods are represented as member methods on the objects returned when
creating a widget.  Typically the widget and effect objects contain
some common methods like `destroy`, `enable`, `disable`, and `option`.

For example, the `Datepicker` widget has a method for setting the
date. The JavaScript snippet for this may look like:

    #javascript
    $("#datepicker").datepicker("setDate", "03/14/2010");

The WebSharperâ„¢ bindings contain (possibly overloaded) methods with
corresponding names:

    #fsharp
    datePicker.SetDate(new JDate(2010,03,14))
