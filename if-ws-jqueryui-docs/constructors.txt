# Constructors

Constructor functions are provided for all `Widgets` and `Effects`.
There are typically a few options for constructing Widgets depending
on the desired configuration.

In the original jQuery UI library configuration settings are usually
passed as a JavaScript object.  For example, a calendar may be
initialized in a disabled state by passing a configuration setting to
the constructor function:

    #javascript
    $("#datepicker").datepicker({{ disabled: true }});

In WebSharperâ„¢ configuration settings for any widget are represented
by a corresponding configuration type and may be passed to the
constructors as parameters:

    #fsharp
    let conf = Datepicker.DatepickerConfiguration()
    conf.Disabled <- true
    let datePicker = Datepicker.New(conf)
