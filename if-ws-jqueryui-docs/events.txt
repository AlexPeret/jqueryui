# Events

jQuery UI widgets allow to add event handlers to widgets. For example,
the `Datepicker` widget supports the `onSelect` event:

    #javascript
    $("#datepicker").datepicker({
       onSelect: function(dateText, inst) { ... }
    });

In the WebSharperâ„¢ binding Events are also represented as
functions. To add an event handler for a Datepicker objects you use:

    #fsharp
    datePicker.OnSelect (fun date -> ...)

The `OnSelect` function accepts a callback function of type
`JavaScript.Date -> unit`.  The signatures of the callback functions
differ slightly from their JavaScript counterparts.  For example, the
JavaScript callback function may accept two arguments, with the second
one representing a reference to the `datePicker` object and the date
is passed as a string rather than a `DateTime` object.

In contrast with other method invocations, events may be applied to
objects that has not yet been initialized (rendered).  If an event is
attached to a non initialized object it is implicitly delayed until
the rendering of the object. Therefore the following code is
perfectly valid:

    #fsharp
    let datePicker = DatePicker.New() 
    datePicker.OnSelect(fun date -> ...)
